## 1. Structural / Authoritative Relationships

These define where something comes from or what defines it.

### • DEFINED_BY
Control implementation → policy, standard, or procedure
Component → architecture definition or baseline

Example:
Control AC-2 implementation DEFINED_BY Access Control Policy

### • DERIVED_FROM
Tailored control → baseline control (e.g. NIST SP 800-53)
Parameterized control → generic control definition
Useful for overlays and profiles

### • GOVERNED_BY
System or component → policy or regulatory framework
Often links to:
ISO/IEC 27001
Internal security policies

## 2. Dependency & Composition Relationships

These capture how system elements rely on each other.

### • DEPENDS_ON
Service → infrastructure component
Control → external system capability
Example:
Backup Service DEPENDS_ON Object Storage

### • COMPOSED_OF
System → subsystems
Component → subcomponents
Helps model layered architectures

### • HOSTED_ON / RUNS_ON
Application → VM / container platform / Kubernetes node
Common in cloud-native SSPs

## 3. Implementation & Responsibility Relationships

These map controls to actual enforcement points.

### • IMPLEMENTED_BY
Control → component or service
One of the most critical SSP relationships

Example:
IA-2 IMPLEMENTED_BY Identity Provider

### • PROVIDED_BY
Capability → shared service (e.g., IAM, logging platform)
Frequently used in hybrid/cloud SSPs

### • RESPONSIBLE_FOR
Role or team → control or component
Useful for operational accountability (not always explicit in OSCAL, but often modeled via props/links)

## 4. Data Flow & Interaction Relationships

These describe runtime behavior and integration.

### • CONNECTS_TO
Network-level relationships
Often complements diagrams rather than replaces them

### • EXCHANGES_DATA_WITH
Application ↔ application
Important for:
data classification
trust boundaries

### • PROTECTS / MONITORS
Security service → protected asset

Example:
WAF PROTECTS Web Application
SIEM MONITORS Infrastructure

## 5. Evidence & Traceability Relationships

Critical for auditability and continuous compliance.

### • EVIDENCED_BY
Control implementation → evidence artifact (logs, reports)

### • VERIFIED_BY
Control → assessment procedure or test case

### • DOCUMENTED_IN
Component or control → documentation artifact

## 6. Lifecycle & Operational Relationships

Less standardized but increasingly important.

### • MANAGED_BY
Component → platform team or automation system

### • DEPLOYED_VIA
Component → CI/CD pipeline

### • BACKED_UP_BY
Data store → backup system
